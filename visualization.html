                    <h3>1. Bar Plots: Top Polluted Cities and Pollutant Distribution by State</h3>
                    <p>Bar plots were used to identify the top 10 most polluted cities and to see which states have the highest concentration of specific pollutants. The charts clearly show that industrial and metropolitan areas like Noida, Gurugram, and Delhi face severe air quality challenges. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that different pollutants are dominant in different states, indicating varied sources of pollution across the country.</p>

                    <p>This cluster bar chart breaks down the contribution of each pollutant to the total pollution in the top 10 most polluted cities. It highlights that PM2.5 and PM10 are the most significant contributors to poor air quality in a majority of these urban centers.</p>

                    <h3>3. Box Plot: National Pollutant Distribution</h3>
                    <p>The box plot provides a statistical summary of the distribution for each major air pollutant across the country. PM10 and PM2.5 exhibit the widest spread and the most significant outliers, confirming they are primary drivers of severe air quality issues in specific regions. In contrast, SO₂ and NH₃ levels are relatively lower and more stable. The skewed distributions and numerous outliers for most pollutants suggest that acute pollution events in certain areas heavily impact the national average.</p>

                    <h3>4. Heatmap: Correlation Between Pollutants</h3>
                    <p>A heatmap was used to understand the relationships between different pollutants. The most striking observation is the strong positive correlation between PM10 and PM2.5, which is expected as PM2.5 is a subset of PM10. This strong relationship warrants a more detailed look via a scatter plot.</p>

                    <h3>5. Scatter Plot: PM10 vs. PM2.5</h3>
                    <p>This scatter plot confirms the direct proportionality between PM10 and PM2.5. Most data points form a dense diagonal cluster, indicating that as one increases, so does the other. The concentration of points in the bottom-left suggests that most locations have relatively low levels of both pollutants. Crucially, the absence of points in the bottom-right (high PM2.5, low PM10) aligns with the physical reality that PM2.5 particles are a component of PM10.</p>
